## Disable and enable the whiteboard

The whiteboard interface in defined in the `packages/agora-classroom-sdk/src/infra/stores/common/base.ts`folder:

   ```tsx
     /**
       * Board releated APIs
       */
      get boardApi() {
        return EduUIStoreBase._boardApi;
      }
  ```
To turn the whiteboard on or off in your local  <Vg k="FC"/> environment:

. In \<I DONT KNOW WHICH FILE>, add the following code:

  - disable:

    ```tsx
    this.boardApi.disable();
    ```
  - enable:
    ```tsx
    this.boardApi.enable();
    ```
